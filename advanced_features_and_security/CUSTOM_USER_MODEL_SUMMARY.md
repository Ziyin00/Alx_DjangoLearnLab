# Custom User Model Implementation Summary

## Overview

This project successfully implements a custom user model for Django that extends AbstractUser with additional fields and functionality. The implementation includes a custom user manager, admin interface, and proper integration with existing models.

## Deliverables

### 1. Custom User Model (`accounts/models.py`)

- **CustomUser Model**: Extends AbstractUser with:
  - `email`: EmailField (unique, used as USERNAME_FIELD)
  - `date_of_birth`: DateField (optional)
  - `profile_photo`: ImageField (optional, uploads to 'profile_photos/')
- **CustomUserManager**: Custom manager with:
  - `create_user()`: Handles email-based user creation
  - `create_superuser()`: Handles superuser creation with proper validation

### 2. Admin Configuration (`accounts/admin.py`)

- **CustomUserAdmin**: Custom admin class with:
  - Custom forms for user creation and editing
  - Proper field organization in fieldsets
  - Search and filter capabilities
  - Display of custom fields in list view

### 3. Settings Configuration (`LibraryProject/settings.py`)

- **AUTH_USER_MODEL**: Set to 'accounts.CustomUser'
- **INSTALLED_APPS**: Added 'accounts' app
- **Media Configuration**: Added MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT for file uploads
- **URL Configuration**: Added media file serving for development

### 4. Model Integration

- **Updated relationship_app/models.py**:
  - Changed from direct User import to `get_user_model()`
  - Maintains compatibility with existing UserProfile model
- **Created forms.py**: Added missing form classes for the relationship app

### 5. Database Migrations

- **Fresh Migration Strategy**:
  - Removed existing database and migrations
  - Created new migrations for all apps
  - Successfully applied all migrations
- **Custom User Migration**: Created and applied accounts.0001_initial.py

## Testing

- ✅ Custom user model created successfully
- ✅ Migrations applied without errors
- ✅ Superuser created with custom model
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ Admin interface configured for custom user

## Usage

1. **User Registration**: Users can register with email and additional fields
2. **Admin Management**: Full admin interface for managing custom user fields
3. **Profile Photos**: Users can upload and manage profile photos
4. **Date of Birth**: Optional date field for user profiles
