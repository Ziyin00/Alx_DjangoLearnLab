- Ensure `TEMPLATES` setting includes `BASE_DIR / 'templates'`
- Verify template files exist in correct directories

### Issue 3: "Static files not found"

**Solution**: Configure static files

- Ensure `STATICFILES_DIRS` is set in settings.py
- Run `python3 manage.py collectstatic` if needed

### Issue 4: "Database is locked" Error

**Solution**: Stop the development server and restart

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## Database Management

### View Database Contents

```bash
# Access Django shell
python3 manage.py shell

# View all users
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
User.objects.all()

# View all posts
from blog.models import Post
Post.objects.all()

# Exit shell
exit()
```

### Reset Database (if needed)

```bash
# Delete database file
rm db.sqlite3

# Delete migrations
rm -rf blog/migrations/0001_initial.py
rm -rf accounts/migrations/

# Recreate migrations
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate

# Create new superuser
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
